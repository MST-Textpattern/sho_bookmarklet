This is a simple plugin for Textpattern. It will allow you to use a bookmarklet to add links to your Textpattern install. Very rudimentary.

Installation
------------

Install and activate the plugin in the Textpattern admin area.

Usage
-----

Navigate to the extensions tab in your Textpattern admin area. Drag the `Add to links`box to your browser's bookmarks bar.

When you wish to create a link for a site you are visiting simply click on the bookmarklet.

Caveats
-------

This plugin/bookmarklet has only been tested with Textpattern 4.5.3 and Chrome. If it does not work with Firefox or Safari, please create an issue.
